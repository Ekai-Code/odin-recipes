        <li>6 pork chops</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons steak seasoning</li>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can or bottle beer</li>
        <li>1 (18 ounce) bottle barbeque sauce</li>
        <li>2 onions, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle pork chops with steak seasoning. Brown both sides in a skillet, then transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Pour beer into the skillet and stir until all browned bits have been incorporated.

            Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 1 to 2 hours.
